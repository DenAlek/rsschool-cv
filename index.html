                    Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
                    learning new things from everywhere etc.).</li>
                <li>Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)</li>
                <li>Code examples (LATEST)</li>
                <li>Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
                    freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
                    Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)</li>
                <li>Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)</li>
